# Image Classifier: Identifying Dog Breeds

Welcome to my Image Classifier project! In this repository, you'll find my ongoing work on creating an image classifier to identify dog breeds.

## Project Overview

This project builds upon the foundation of a pre-trained image classifier that can already identify dog breeds. However, I'm taking it a step further by developing my own image classifier from scratch.

## Ongoing Work

While the pre-trained image classifier provided a solid starting point, I'm now in the process of training my own model using a custom dataset. This involves collecting and labeling images of various dog breeds, fine-tuning the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Key Differences

The main difference between the uploaded pre-trained image classifier and my ongoing work is that the pre-trained model was trained on a large dataset and can accurately classify dog breeds. However, my goal is to create a personalized image classifier that not only identifies dog breeds but also incorporates my own unique training data and potentially expands to other categories in the future.

## Project Structure

- `pretrained_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the pre-trained image classifier.
- `ongoing_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook documenting my progress on the ongoing image classifier.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training the ongoing classifier.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my journey as I continue to improve and refine the image classifier.

## Feedback and Contributions

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to help enhance the image classifier. If you have any ideas or improvements, please don't hesitate to reach out or submit a pull request.

Happy classifying!
